// Another thing that I like about you is how resilient you are
// I'm sure it was tough getting here!
// And lucky for you, you're almost there.

// Never give up on a blank page

// I've got a riddle for you
// Since I know you like puzzles

// Let var a = avogadro's number, without the decimal or *10^?

// Let var b = how many plates Sai Cheemalapati can bench

// let var c = the simplifcation of the following logic puzzle:
// A + (!A B C) + (A B C) + (B !C) + !B

// And now for the hardest. If you get stuck on this one, don't waste your whole day
// just text me:

"What's your phone number Josh?" asked Karmyn. 

"Well," said Josh, "if you replace the first digit of your number with the next lowest odd digit, you get my number." 

"And the code?" 

"Curiously," said Josh, "the product of the four numbers in that number is equal to the square root of my phone number." 

"But that's insufficient information," pointed out Karmyn. 

"Yes," said Josh. "But if I were to tell you the sum of those four digits, then you'd have enough information." 

What is Josh's code? Note: In this magic land, the "code" is four digits.
