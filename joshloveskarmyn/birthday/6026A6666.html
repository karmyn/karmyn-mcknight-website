    So, here we are- you kicked some ass and took some names.

    I hope you enjoyed this, and it didn't frustrate you too much. I can't really afford to buy you something nice for your birthday quite yet- but at least I can write code! I'll also make karmynmcknight.com into an actual website if you want me to :).

    I also hope that you have a fantastic birthday, because you deserve that and more. Keep on being the sweetest girl I know.

    Give me a call to here some more nice things when you get a moment.

    -Josh
